# Data-Analysis-and-Machine-Learning-on-Electric-Vehicle-Dataset
Analyzing a electric vehicle dataset for insights as to what vehicle would be the cheapest. 


**PLEASE NOTE, I didn't upload the pre-cleaned dataset because the file is too big. You can download it in the link listed below. I have attatched the cleaned version of the dataframe.**


## Dataset

The dataset can be accessed from a government data site:
[EV dataset](https://data.wa.gov/Transportation/Electric-Vehicle-Population-Data/f6w7-q2d2/about_data)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Creating the Virtual Environment

To isolate project dependencies, create a virtual environment:

```
python -m venv venv
```

### 2. Activating the Virtual Environment

Activate the virtual environment with the following command:

```
source ./venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Installing Required Libraries

Install all necessary libraries by running:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Running the Prediction Notebook
